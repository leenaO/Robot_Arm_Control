Robot arm control
-----
We've 6 robot arm components which represent the joints of the arm. Our goal is to design UI that will control the joints motion, so we will have 6 motors to control it.

First write a HTML code to define a structure of a webpage, then style the webpage by using CSS.

This is my webpage!

We need to build a database table of 6 columns. My result:

Finally connect the database with control panel using PHP. (you can see the code above)
