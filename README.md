Robot arm control
-----
We've 6 arm components which represent the joints of the arm. Our goal is to design UI that will control the joints motion, so we will have 6 motors to control it.

first write a HTML code to define a structure of a web page, then style the web pages by using CSS.

This is my webpage! 
   ![control](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46565265/128602610-213eaa63-7bcc-4add-9855-f7e8121443c2.png)
